# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze if there is any correlations between the test overall passing percentage and the school budget. During the project, the school board has noticed that there is evidence of academic dishonesty showing that reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. This challenge is to replace the reading and math scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping other schools' data. After fixing the data, we will compare the updated data with the original data to see if there is any changes. 


## Results

###  How is the district summary affected?

We have two district summaries above. The one on the top represents the updated district summary and the bottom represents the original district summary. We can see that the "Total Schools", "Total Students" and "Total Budget" numbers stay the same. In the updated district summary, it drops 0.2% on the Passing Math Percentage, 0.3% on the Passing Reading Percentage and 0.1% on the Overall Passing Percentage. It means that the math and reading scores for the ninth grader in Thomas High School are higher than overall average.

We have two pictures above showing the updated school summary and the original school summary. All the rows on both pictures are the same except the Thomas High School row. On tha updated school summary which is the one on the top shows that it drops 0.1% on the "% Passing Math" column, drops 0.3% on the "% Passing Reading" and 0.3% on the "% Overall Passing" column. It means that the passing percentages for ninth graders in Thomas High School are higher than the passing percentage for the whole Thomas High School.


### How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other school?
