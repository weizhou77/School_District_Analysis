# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze if there is any correlations between the test overall passing percentage and the school budget. During the project, the school board has noticed that there is evidence of academic dishonesty showing that reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. This challenge is to replace the reading and math scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping other schools' data. After fixing the data, we will compare the updated data with the original data to see if there is any changes.
